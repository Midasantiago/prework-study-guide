# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application was created for boot camp students as a study guide during for their prework notes. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. During the process I learned how to structure a webapge and add its content using HTML. I also learned how to style and organize the webpage using CSS, and to give it functionality using Javascript. Using this application, students will be able to prepare themselves for the full course ahead.

## Usage

To use this study guide application, students can review the notes listed for each section. If needed, the application can suggest which content to study first, by opening the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage browser. A list of the topics will appear there along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
